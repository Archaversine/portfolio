title: Evolutionary Computation - Smart Rockets
author: Adam Brohl
---

A remake of [this project](https://github.com/Archaversine/Neuroevolution-Missiles),
which was based off of [TheCodingTrain's p5js project](https://thecodingtrain.com/challenges/29-smart-rockets-in-p5js).

In this project, small rockets try to reach the red circle on the other side of
the wall. If they hit the wall, then they die and cannot progress any further.
The rockets eventually get better and better at going around the wall via a 
genetic algorithm.

## Genetic Algorithm Parameters

The following parameters are used for the genetic algorithm:

| Parameter         | Value        |
|-------------------|--------------|
| Population Size   | 200          |
| Lifespan (Frames) | 500          |
| Crossover Rate    | 80%          |
| Crossover Type    | Single Point |
| Mutation Rate     | 1%           |
| Elitism           | Top 1        |

## Graphics

This project was implemented using [Gloss](http://gloss.ouroborus.net/). The 
graphics are simple, but convey the point, here is a video of what the 
genetic algorithm looks like in action:
