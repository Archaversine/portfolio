        <h2 id="algebra-of-types">Algebra of Types</h2>
<p>Haskell is one of the few programming languages that fully supports Algebraic
Data Types (ADTs) without requiring silly workarounds. As one might expect,
ADTs have algebraic properties similar to algebra with numbers. These operations
include addition, multiplication, exponentiation, and even differentiation. This
post explores how to implement automatic type differentiation in Haskell.</p>
<h3 id="type-cardinality">Type Cardinality</h3>
<p>When working with types, an often useful piece of information to know is how
many valid inhabitants (the cardinality) a type has. For example, a boolean
has exactly two valid inhabitants: true and false. The cardinality of a type
<span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is represented by the notation <span class="math inline">\(|T|\)</span>. If two different types have the same
cardinality, they are said to be isomorphic. This is because a bidirectional
one-to-one mapping can be constructed between both types.</p>
<p>Let’s start with one of the simplest types in Haskell: the unit type. The unit
type (written as <code>()</code>) has exactly one inhabitant: <code>()</code>. Because of this,
the cardinality of the unit type is one (<span class="math inline">\(|()| = 1\)</span>). When performing
multiplication, the unit type can be thought of as an identity value.</p>
<p>The next interesting type is the sum type. The most common sum type in Haskell
is the <code>Either</code> type:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">data</span> <span class="dt">Either</span> a b <span class="ot">=</span> <span class="dt">Left</span> a <span class="op">|</span> <span class="dt">Right</span> b</span></code></pre></div>
<p>To determine the cardinality of this type, lets look at <code>Either</code> with some
types we’ve already looked at: unit and boolean (<code>Either () Bool</code>). Looking
at the <code>Left</code> constructor, there is only one inhabitant: <code>Left ()</code>. And
looking at the <code>Right</code> constructor, there are two inhabitants: <code>Right True</code>
and <code>Right False</code>. So in total, there are <span class="math inline">\(1 + 2 = 3\)</span> inhabitants of
<code>Either () Bool</code>, so its cardinality is 3. A sharp reader may notice that <em>sum</em>
types <em>add</em> cardinalities together, and this is correct. To generalize this
for any two types <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> with <code>Either</code>:
<span class="math inline">\(|Either\space\alpha\space\beta| = |\alpha| + |\beta|\)</span>. In fact, for any sum type <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(S = \{s_1, s_2, ..., s_n\}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(s_i\)</span> is the <em>ith</em> constructor of <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>:
<span class="math inline">\(|S|=\sum_{i=1}^n|s_i|\)</span>.</p>
<p>As one might expect, this pattern extends to product types. Computing the
cardinality of a product type is equal to the product of its inner cardinalities
multiplied together. In other words, for some product type <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> where
<span class="math inline">\(P = \{p_1, p_2, ..., p_n\}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(|P|=\prod_{i=1}^n|p_i|\)</span>.</p>
<p>The behavior of both sum types and product types can be used together to compute
the cardinality of any arbitrary ADT. Consider the following example:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">data</span> <span class="dt">MyType</span> a b <span class="ot">=</span> <span class="dt">First</span> <span class="dt">Bool</span> (<span class="dt">Either</span> a <span class="dt">Bool</span>)</span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>                <span class="op">|</span> <span class="dt">Second</span> (<span class="dt">Either</span> a b)</span>
<span id="cb2-3"><a href="#cb2-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>                <span class="op">|</span> <span class="dt">Third</span> a b <span class="dt">Bool</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now lets compute the cardinality of <code>MyType</code> parameterized by any two types
<span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>. First, we see that <code>MyType</code> is a sum type with tree
constructors, so its cardinality must be the sum of the cardinalities of its
three constructors. Lets start with the first: <code>First Bool (Either a Bool)</code>.
This is a product type consisting of <code>Bool</code> and <code>Either a Bool</code>, so the
cardinality will be <span class="math inline">\(|Bool| + |Either\space\alpha\space Bool| = 2 + |Either\space\alpha\space Bool|\)</span>.
And re-using the rule for sum types, this simplifies to: <span class="math inline">\(2 \times (|\alpha| + |Bool|) = 4 + 2|\alpha|\)</span>.
We do not know what type <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> is, so we cannot simplify any further.
Repeating this process for the next two constructors, we get that the second
constructor has the cardinality <span class="math inline">\(|\alpha| + |\beta|\)</span> and the third has the
cardinality <span class="math inline">\(2|\alpha||\beta|\)</span>. Thus, the whole cardinality for <code>MyType</code> is
<span class="math inline">\(4 + 2|\alpha| + |\alpha| + |\beta| + 2|\alpha||\beta| = 4 + 3|\alpha| + |\beta| + 2|\alpha||\beta|\)</span>.</p>
<p>Before moving on to the next part, there is actually one more type of
significance: the <code>Void</code> type. In Haskell this is defined as:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">data</span> <span class="dt">Void</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Unlike the sum and product types, <code>Void</code> does not have any constructors. What
this means in the context of a program is that it is impossible to create a
value of this type. Because of this behavior, <code>Void</code> is often used in proofs
to represent contradictary values, and to prove impossibilities. The cardainality
of this type is 0, because it has 0 inhabitants.</p>
<p>Lets look at the consequenes of this. Consider the type <code>Either Void Bool</code>.
Using the cardinality rules previously defined, we can deduce <span class="math inline">\(|Either\space Void\space Bool| = 0 + 2 = 2\)</span>.
And this makes sense. Because the <code>Left</code> constructor of Either requires a value
of type <code>Void</code>, <code>Left</code> cannot have any inhabitants. This means that the only
inhabitants of <code>Either Void Bool</code> can be created using the <code>Right</code> constructor.
The <code>Right</code> constructor only has a <code>Bool</code> value, so we know there are only
two inhabitants. This matches up with our previously calculated cardinality of
2. This also has implications for product types as well. The cardinality of
<code>(a, b)</code> is <span class="math inline">\(|a| \times |b|\)</span>, which means that if either <span class="math inline">\(|a|\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(|b|\)</span> is 0,
then the cardinality of the entire tuple is also 0. This makes sense because
a tuple requires a value to be specified for both the left and the right side
at the same time.</p>
<h2 id="isomorphisms">Isomorphisms</h2>
<p>Now that we are able to represent ADTs as algebraic expressions, we can now
look at one of the benefits of this sort of representation: isomorphisms. An
isomorphism states that given two arbitrary types <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>, the
two are isomorphic if there exists two one-to-one mappings <span class="math inline">\(f : \alpha\rightarrow\beta\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(g : \beta\rightarrow\alpha\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(f \circ g = g \circ f = id\)</span>.</p>
<p>Lets example a simple morphism between the following two types:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">data</span> <span class="dt">Either</span> <span class="ot">=</span> <span class="dt">Left</span> () <span class="op">|</span> <span class="dt">Right</span> ()</span>
<span id="cb4-2"><a href="#cb4-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">data</span> <span class="dt">Bool</span> <span class="ot">=</span> <span class="dt">True</span> <span class="op">|</span> <span class="dt">False</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>In order to show that these two types are isomorphic, we need to specify
mappings between both types:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ot">f ::</span> <span class="dt">Either</span> <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> <span class="dt">Bool</span></span>
<span id="cb5-2"><a href="#cb5-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>f (<span class="dt">Left</span> ())  <span class="ot">=</span> <span class="dt">False</span></span>
<span id="cb5-3"><a href="#cb5-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>f (<span class="dt">Right</span> ()) <span class="ot">=</span> <span class="dt">True</span></span>
<span id="cb5-4"><a href="#cb5-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb5-5"><a href="#cb5-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ot">g ::</span> <span class="dt">Bool</span> <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> <span class="dt">Either</span></span>
<span id="cb5-6"><a href="#cb5-6" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>g <span class="dt">True</span>  <span class="ot">=</span> <span class="dt">Right</span> ()</span>
<span id="cb5-7"><a href="#cb5-7" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>g <span class="dt">False</span> <span class="ot">=</span> <span class="dt">Left</span> ()</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And we need to show that composing the two mappings in either order is
equivalent to the identity function. Since each type only has a small number
of inhabitants, we can simply show every possible scenario:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span id="cb6-1"><a href="#cb6-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>f (g  <span class="dt">True</span>) <span class="ot">=&gt;</span> f (<span class="dt">Right</span> ()) <span class="ot">=&gt;</span> <span class="dt">True</span></span>
<span id="cb6-2"><a href="#cb6-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>f (g <span class="dt">False</span>) <span class="ot">=&gt;</span> f (<span class="dt">Left</span>  ()) <span class="ot">=&gt;</span> <span class="dt">False</span></span>
<span id="cb6-3"><a href="#cb6-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb6-4"><a href="#cb6-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>g (f (<span class="dt">Right</span> ())) <span class="ot">=&gt;</span> g <span class="dt">True</span>  <span class="ot">=&gt;</span> <span class="dt">Right</span> ()</span>
<span id="cb6-5"><a href="#cb6-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>g (f (<span class="dt">Left</span>  ())) <span class="ot">=&gt;</span> g <span class="dt">False</span> <span class="ot">=&gt;</span> <span class="dt">Left</span>  ()</span></code></pre></div>
<p>But lets look further into why exact this is. What exactly is necessary for
these two types to be isomorphic? The answer is the have the same cardinality,
or same number of inhabitants. To further explain, if the two types do not have
the same cardinality, then one will have more inhabitants than the other. This
means that mapping from the type with more inhabitants to the other will
ultimately result in a loss of information. And because of this, it becomes
impossible to create two lawful mappings that satisfy the isomorphism laws.
Looking at the previous example, the cardinality of <code>Either</code> is <span class="math inline">\(1 + 1 = 2\)</span>, and
the cardinality of <code>Bool</code> is also <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>. In fact, for any two types <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>, if <span class="math inline">\(|\alpha| = |\beta|\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\cong\beta\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> is
isomorphic to <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>).</p>
<h3 id="derivatives">Derivatives</h3>
<p>Apart from addition, multiplication, and exponentiation, one can also take
the <em>derivative</em> of a type, which has some interesting properties. Lets consider
the following type:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb7"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span id="cb7-1"><a href="#cb7-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">data</span> <span class="dt">MyType</span> a <span class="ot">=</span> <span class="dt">MyType</span> a a</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We know that the cardinality of <code>MyType a</code> is <span class="math inline">\(a \times b\)</span> (where <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>
are cardinalities, not types). Lets take the derivative of <code>MyType a</code> with
respect to <code>a</code>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{\partial}{\partial a}(a \times a) = 2a\]</span></p>
<p>What exactly does this mean? Here, when we are taking the derivative of
<code>MyType a</code>, we are actually computing the <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/index.php?title=Zipper">zipper</a>
of <code>MyType a</code>. If we focus one one particular <code>a</code> in <code>MyType a</code>, we would end
up with one of the folllowing types:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb8"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span id="cb8-1"><a href="#cb8-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">data</span> <span class="dt">MyType1</span> a <span class="ot">=</span> <span class="dt">MyType1</span> a _</span>
<span id="cb8-2"><a href="#cb8-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">data</span> <span class="dt">MyType2</span> a <span class="ot">=</span> <span class="dt">MyType2</span> _ a</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The underscore represents the <code>a</code> we are focusing on. Here, we can see that
there are two different <code>a</code>s we can focus on, and in both cases we have another
<code>a</code> that sits in the context. Using this intuition only, we could create a
zipper type that uses the information:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb9"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span id="cb9-1"><a href="#cb9-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">data</span> <span class="dt">MyTypeZipper</span> a <span class="ot">=</span> <span class="dt">MyTypeZipper</span> <span class="dt">Bool</span> a</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>Bool</code> represents which <code>a</code> we are focusing on, and the other <code>a</code> represents
the value of the <code>a</code> we are not focusing on. Now let’s revisit the derivative.
Recall that the cardinality of the derivative of <code>MyType a</code> was <span class="math inline">\(2a\)</span>. Using the
cardinality rules in reverse, we can see that <span class="math inline">\(2a\)</span> is some kind of product type
where the left side has a cardinality of 2 and the right side has a cardinality
of <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>. We also know from earlier that <code>Bool</code> has a cardinality of 2, so we can
assume that the left side is a boolean. We don’t know exactly what <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is, so we
know the right side of the product type must be <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, so we’ll end up with some
type that looks like <code>(Bool, a)</code>. If we compare this to the <code>MyTypeZipper</code> type,
we can see that these two types are actually isomorphic because they have the
same cardinality.</p>
<p>This also works on more complex types. Lets create the zipper for the following
type by computing its derivative:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb10"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span id="cb10-1"><a href="#cb10-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">data</span> <span class="dt">MyType</span> a <span class="ot">=</span> <span class="dt">One</span> a <span class="op">|</span> <span class="dt">Two</span> a a</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We’ll start by computing the cardinality:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[|MyType\space\alpha|= a + a \times a = a + a^2, a = |\alpha|\]</span></p>
<p>And now compute the derivative:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{\partial}{\partial a}(a + a^2) = 1 + 2a\]</span></p>
<p>And construct a corresponding ADT:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb11"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span id="cb11-1"><a href="#cb11-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">data</span> <span class="dt">MyZipper</span> a <span class="ot">=</span> <span class="dt">Either</span> () (<span class="dt">Bool</span>, a)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now lets understand the intuition. In <code>MyType a</code>, there are two possible
constructors. If we focus on the <code>a</code> in the first constructor, then we don’t
have any other contextual information. Thus, we represent this scenario with
<code>Left ()</code>. In the second constructor, we can see that there are two different
<code>a</code>s we can focus on (which we specify in the zipper with a <code>Bool</code>), and will
always end up with an extra <code>a</code> in the context. Hence, the <code>Right</code> constructor
will take in a value of type <code>(Bool, a)</code>.</p>
<h2 id="automatically-computing-the-derivative">Automatically Computing the Derivative</h2>
<p>Now, lets look at this in a Haskell program. Is there a way to automatically
compute the derivative of a type using type level programming? If we make some
constraints on what sorts of ADTs we take in as input, then the answer is yes
we can.</p>
<p>Lets start by defining a type family which computes the derivative of a type:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb12"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span id="cb12-1"><a href="#cb12-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">-- derivative of ty with respect to x</span></span>
<span id="cb12-2"><a href="#cb12-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">type</span> <span class="kw">family</span> <span class="dt">TypeDeriv</span> (<span class="ot">x ::</span> <span class="dt">Type</span>) (<span class="ot">ty ::</span> <span class="dt">Type</span>)<span class="ot"> ::</span> <span class="dt">Type</span> <span class="kw">where</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>As input, we are only going to pass in types that are constructed in one of
the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using the <code>Either</code> type</li>
<li>Using the tuple type</li>
<li>Using the <code>()</code> (unit) type</li>
<li>Using the <code>Void</code> type</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note: I could have also added <code>-&gt;</code> for exponentiation, but I am leaving that
out for simplicity.</em></p>
<p>Using standard differentiation rules, we can algebraically compute the
derivatives for each of these types:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{\partial|\alpha+\beta|}{\partial x}=\frac{\partial a}{\partial x}+\frac{\partial b}{\partial x}\]</span>
<span class="math display">\[\frac{\partial|(\alpha\times\beta)|}{\partial x}=\frac{\partial a}{\partial x}b+a\frac{\partial b}{\partial x}\]</span>
<span class="math display">\[\frac{\partial|Unit|}{\partial x}=\frac{\partial}{\partial x}(1)=0\]</span>
<span class="math display">\[\frac{\partial|Void|}{\partial x}=\frac{\partial}{\partial x}(0)=0\]</span>
<span class="math display">\[\frac{\partial x}{\partial x}=1\]</span></p>
<p>Now, we can use these formulas in our type family:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb13"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span id="cb13-1"><a href="#cb13-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">type</span> <span class="kw">family</span> <span class="dt">TypeDeriv</span> (<span class="ot">x ::</span> <span class="dt">Type</span>) (<span class="ot">ty ::</span> <span class="dt">Type</span>)<span class="ot"> ::</span> <span class="dt">Type</span> <span class="kw">where</span></span>
<span id="cb13-2"><a href="#cb13-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="dt">TypeDeriv</span> x (<span class="dt">Either</span> a b) <span class="ot">=</span> <span class="dt">Either</span> (<span class="dt">TypeDeriv</span> x a) (<span class="dt">TypeDeriv</span> x b)</span>
<span id="cb13-3"><a href="#cb13-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="dt">TypeDeriv</span> x (a, b) <span class="ot">=</span> <span class="dt">Either</span> (<span class="dt">TypeDeriv</span> x a, b) (a, <span class="dt">TypeDeriv</span> x b)</span>
<span id="cb13-4"><a href="#cb13-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="dt">TypeDeriv</span> x ()   <span class="ot">=</span> <span class="dt">Void</span></span>
<span id="cb13-5"><a href="#cb13-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="dt">TypeDeriv</span> x <span class="dt">Void</span> <span class="ot">=</span> <span class="dt">Void</span></span>
<span id="cb13-6"><a href="#cb13-6" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="dt">TypeDeriv</span> x x    <span class="ot">=</span> ()</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Lets try this on the previous example:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb14"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span id="cb14-1"><a href="#cb14-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">data</span> <span class="dt">MyType</span> a <span class="ot">=</span> <span class="dt">One</span> a <span class="op">|</span> <span class="dt">Two</span> a a</span></code></pre></div>
<p>First, we need to rewrite <code>MyType</code> in terms of those supported by our type
family:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb15"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span id="cb15-1"><a href="#cb15-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">type</span> <span class="dt">MyType</span> a <span class="ot">=</span> <span class="dt">Either</span> a (a, a)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And since type families have limitations on their resolution capabilites, we
will create a fake arbitrary type <code>A</code> to act as a place holder for what would
be a typical type variable <code>a</code>.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb16"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span id="cb16-1"><a href="#cb16-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">data</span> <span class="dt">A</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now, lets ask the compiler by using a hole what the type of <code>TypeDeriv A (Either A (A, A))</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb17"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span id="cb17-1"><a href="#cb17-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ot">myValue ::</span> <span class="dt">TypeDeriv</span> <span class="dt">A</span> (<span class="dt">MyType</span> <span class="dt">A</span>)</span>

<p>We can see that the type family came up with the type <code>Either () (Either ((), A) (A, ()))</code>
instead of our previous answer of <code>Either () (Bool, a)</code>. When we came up with
an answer by hand, we did additional algebraic manipulations to simplify the answer.
Currently, the type family does not have the capability to do that (but could
theoretically!). We can prove that the type family returned a valid answer by
proving the two are isomorphic. If we look at both answers, we see that they
both follow the pattern <code>Either () _</code>, so we know that at least that part is
isomorphic because they are exactly the same. Now, we have to prove that
<code>Either ((), A) (A, ())</code> is isomorphic to <code>(Bool, a)</code>. Lets compute the cardinality
of the first. When doing this, we get <span class="math inline">\(1 \times A + A \times 1 = A + A = 2A\)</span>.
This is equivalent to the cardinality of <code>(Bool, a)</code> which is <span class="math inline">\(2 \times A = 2A\)</span>.
We see these two are isomorphic, and thus, the type family returned the correct
answer.</p>
