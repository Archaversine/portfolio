    <h3>Quantum Tic-Tac-Toe</h3>

    <iframe class="embed" src="https://editor.p5js.org/Archaversine/full/0f5-NXhin"></iframe>

    <p>On each players turn, they can do one of three things:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Move Normally</strong>: This acts as regular tic-tac-toe, 
            where you place your X or O on the board. (<em>Note: these aren't
            measured moves, which mean they might move in the future! See the 
            next item for more information.</em>)</li>
        <li><strong>Measure</strong>: When moving normally, you will notice
            that your symbol wiggles around a bit. This is not just for aesthetic
            effects, this is to indicate to you that it may either tunnel or 
            be entangled with another symbol in the future. On your turn, you
            can choose to click one of these blue symbols (even your opponents)
            to measure it. When a symbol is measured, it will turn red and stop
            moving around. Once it is measured, it will never move for the
            rest of the game. When every square is filled up, the game will
            forcibly measure every square to determine the winner.</li>
        <li><strong>Superposition Move</strong>: By clicking on one square and dragging 
            to another square (with the mouse down the entire time), you can elect
            to place your symbol into two squares at the same time. You don't 
            actually make two moves at the same time, you indicate that your
            symbol exists in one of the two squares. When it is measured, 
            one of the squares will turn into your symbol in measured form, and 
            the other will be empty. If you perform a superposition move where
            one of the squares is a blue symbol of your opponent's type, you 
            will create an entangled pair (denoted by the + sign). What this
            means is that one square is an X, and the other is an O. Measuring
            will randomly select which square is which. You can also make a 
            superposition move on a move that is already in superposition (again
            requiring it is on your opponent's symbol). When you do this, you will
            create an entangled system that is also in superposition. Some X's 
            and O's will be smaller and larger than others. These indicate the
            probabilities that each of these squares is a particular symbol. Larger 
            represents a higher probability.
            </li>
    </ul>

    <strong>Miscellaneous Notes:</strong>

    <p>You may notice that sometimes a blue symbol randomly changes location. 
       This is not a bug! This was intentionally added in to add in the concept of 
       quantum teleportation, where objects have a very low probability of "teleporting"
       to the otherside of nearby barriers.
    </p>

    <p>This game also does not have an AI, so for maximum entertainment you will 
       likely want to find a friend or family member to play with. However, there
       is also a "Random Move" button which can be used to emulate an AI which
       makes random moves.

    <h3>Interactive Tesseract</h3>

    <iframe class="embed" src="https://editor.p5js.org/Archaversine/full/MbYX7VTG-"></iframe>

    <p>Visualize the fourth dimension by rotating a tesseract in all four dimensions.
    To assist in visualization, a color gradient is introduced to show distance in the w-axis
    where yellow is near and red is far.
    </p>

    <iframe class="embed" src="https://editor.p5js.org/Archaversine/full/aI4oGIENV"></iframe>

    <p>Visualize the fifth dimension by rotating a 5d-cube in all five dimensions. </p>

    <p>Controls: </p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Click+Drag</strong>: Rotate along the XZ and YZ planes.</li>
        <li><strong>Shift+Click+Drag</strong>: Rotate along the XW and YW planes.</li>
        <li><strong>Alt+Click+Drag</strong>: Rotate along the XY and ZW planes.</li>
        <li><strong>Control+Click+Drag</strong>: Rotate along the XV and YV planes.</li>
        <li><strong>Control+Shift+Click+Drag</strong>: Rotate along the WV and ZV planes.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Like the tesseract, color is used to represent distance along the w-axis. In this
    program, the thickness of the line also represents distance along the v-axis.

    <h3>Evolving Rockets</h3>

    <iframe class="embed" src="https://editor.p5js.org/Archaversine/full/0LYjiBOig"></iframe>

    <p>This project is a simulation that shows how genetic algorithms can be 
    used to create algorithms that "learn" over time. In this example, several 
    small rockets are attempting to learn how to navigate the terrain to reach 
    the red circle. At the beginning, they will all randomly crash in different 
    places and not look very interesting. However, as time goes on, through the 
    process of evolutionary computation the rockets will begin to get better and
    better by creating new rockets that learn from the previous round what works  
    and what doesn't work. To reset their progress, refresh the page!
