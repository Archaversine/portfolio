<p>
I am a PhD student at the University of Rochester supervised under Prof.
Sreepathi Pai. I earned a Bachelor's in Computer Science and a Minor in
Mathematics at Knox College.

I frequently start side projects or toy with concepts, and sometimes make
writeups about them here. I have several projects I have not yet made writeups
for that I plan to here.
